PostMortem

most of the answers will be informed by me being unable to run the
included stats.py file with the included makefile. I'm sure it
falls down to my specific install, but the poetry command was not
running through manage.py so the settings for the django project
were never being set. This comes after trying to get the project
set up inside the WSL which was unsuccessful because of the 
default versions of python that are installed in that environment
and the need to keep them installed for the environment to
continue to function.

I don't think that very many interesting design decisions can be 
construed from what I did. I would like to say that I was
following TDD, but I did not write any unit tests that I
normally would have. I guess I followed DRY principles once(1)
by writing a helper class in the stats.py, for whatever that's
worth.

2.
I found the general structure of the project challenging. Not 
being able to test the code I'm writing is very difficult to me
and not having a lot of knowledge about Poetry made the 
difficulties I had take longer to diagnose. I also have not worked
with this version of django, so that was challenging, but fun to
see some of the streamlining of features that they have made.

3. 
I think the decision I made to not complete all of the 
requirements for this assignment is very interesting. I made
that choice because of the large time commitment that it was 
taking and the large amount of stress that I was under from other
forces. 

4.
I would suggest testing how to set up this environment under
multiple operating systems to make it more flexible to work on.


Thank you for the time it will take to look through this, I 
wish I had more time to complete more of it, and I wish it 
wasn't such a miserable experience to try to get it working,
but thank you for considering me all the same.
